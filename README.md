## Introduction

Terway is a self-developed CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin for ACK (Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes), built on Alibaba Cloud's Elastic Network Interface (ENI) technology. It optimizes cloud resource usage and enhances network performance. Terway supports eBPF for traffic acceleration, reducing latency, and adheres to Kubernetes Network Policy standards for container-to-container access control.

In Terway, each Pod has its own network stack and IP address. Pods on the same ECS (Elastic Compute Service) instance communicate directly, while cross-ECS Pod communication transits directly through VPC ENIs, avoiding encapsulation with technologies like VxLAN for higher communication performance.

## Features

- **ENI Network Mode**: Allocates ENIs to Pods for optimized resource utilization and network performance.
- **Trunking Feature**: Allows Pods to have independent ENIs for flexible security group and switch configurations.
- **Node Pool Network Mode Configuration**: Supports configuring node pools for exclusive ENI usage.
- **Security Policies**: Supports NetworkPolicy and traditional security groups for multi-dimensional network security control.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes eBPF for protocol stack acceleration, ensuring low latency and high throughput.
- **IPv6 Support**: Dual-stack support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Intelligent Computing Lingjun**ï¼šLinjun support.

### Deprecated Features

- **VPC Network Mode**: Direct communication to VPC resources using VPC routing.

- **Exclusive ENI Mode**: Direct ENI attachment to Pods for maximum performance.ï¼ˆReplace with configuring the network mode through node pool dimension as a dedicated ENI.)

## Version Differences

ACK-provided versions are identical to the open-source version, except the Trunking feature is not available in self-hosted clusters.
